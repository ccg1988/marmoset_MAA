There are two folders. 
To run the first one (Fig_2_3ABC_4_5ABC), all you need is to download this folder and run it in MATLAB directly.
There is no need to setup the path nor install third party packages. For details, check the README in that folder.
To run the second one (Fig_3DE_5DE), you need to one extra-step: install the JAGS (very easy). For details, check the README in that folder. 

I have uploaded raw data with two formats. One is platform indepent spreadsheet format, the other one is MATLAB format (used in two folders).
