All files for runing the FigX.m are included in this folder.
Before running those codes, we need to install JAGS or Stan if you want.
I found it is easier to install JAGS than Stan in the Windows System.

JAGS-4.3.1.exe is downloaded from: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/Windows/  

After installed this .exe file, then we need tell the system its location. 
I have uploaded a screenshot (JAGS Path setting.jpg) about how to setup the path in Windows.

All the codes starting with PAL are copied from:
https://www.palamedestoolbox.org/index.html
You could also download the entire toolbox and add all files to MATLAB path.
Here, I copied all related files from authors' original folder.
 
95% Confidence intervals of threshold are available at:
pfhb_reparam.summStats.a.hdi95
Note confidence intervals are differet each time you run the codes.

After generate the figures, I save it as .pdf format and modify them in the Adobe Illustrator.
