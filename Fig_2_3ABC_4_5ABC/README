All files for runing the FigX.m are included in this folder.

All the codes not start with Fig are copied from:
https://github.com/wichmann-lab/psignifit/wiki
You could also download the entire toolbox and add all files to MATLAB path.
Here, I copied all related files from original folder.

The generated figures are almost similar to the one appear in the paper.
